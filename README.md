E.g for *sxhkd*.

```bash
alt + w
"~/Documents/chinguRandomWallpaper/randomWallpaper.sh"

alt + shift + w
"~/Documents/chinguRandomWallpaper/randomWallpaper.sh random"
```

### wallpaper at boot

to have the wallpaper be set after booting add `{path to script}/randomWallpaper.sh reapply` to your `.xinitrc`

## Installation

   `$ git clone https://github.com/Rdkang/chinguRandomWallpaper.git`

2. run the file called **randomWallpaper.sh**

   `$ ./randomWallpaper.sh`

3. thats it! :)

#### Configuration
edit the [config.sh](https://github.com/Rdkang/chinguRandomWallpaper/blob/main/config.sh) file


## Requirements

- any **linux** distro
- xwallpaper
- imagemagick
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)

- [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli) (optional)

## Alternatives

i have now realised can use [feh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Feh), but miss out on one feature from this program.
in this program can specify the minium size of a picture
